# Monte Carlo Tree Search

This is a c++ implementation of Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm.

Also, this is a project for [myself](https://github.com/072jiajia) to practice software development,
so I may update it occasionally and I will try to keep my main branch a runnable version.
Of course, I will add other games & add further technique for mcts.

If you have any advices for this project (including implementation / solid principles / naming convention / optimization / others...),
please feel free to leave a message on the issue page or send me an [email](mailto:jijiawu.cs@gmail.com) to let me know!

## Quick Start

```
    # compile
    make simpledemo
    # Run the demo on tic-tac-toe game
    ./simpledemo
```
